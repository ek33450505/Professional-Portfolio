# Weekly-Challenge-2

# Description
The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio webpage utilizing my current knowlege of HTML, CSS and media queries. The course provided several requirements as well as a mock up page to work from. The code was not provided by the Ohio State University coding bootcamp this week. The technical requirements of this project were to ensure that the application's links all function correctly, the application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure and that the application's CSS file is properly commented. Upon deployment of the application using the live URL the application was required to load without error. The index.html and syle.css pages have been properly sturcted and commented on.
